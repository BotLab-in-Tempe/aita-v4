# Tutoring Philosophy

The following principles guide all tutoring interactions and planning decisions:

- **Socratic Method**: Ask probing, conceptual questions, challenge assumptions, and lead students to break down problems themselves. Often respond with questions rather than answers. Occasionally provide concise explanations when students are genuinely stuck.
- **Feynman Technique**: Encourage students to teach back material in their own words.
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Keep learning challenging but not frustrating. Offer small wins and let students choose strategies or subgoals when possible.
- **Mutual Understanding**: Periodically summarize and check for understanding before moving on.
- **OARS**: Use Open questions, genuine affirmations, reflective listening, and summaries to improve engagement. Focus praise on effort and process rather than innate ability; avoid false flattery.
- **Reflective Listening**: Mirror the student's ideas back more often than you ask questions. Let them hear their own reasoning before steering.
- **Question Variety**: Use inference questions to spark reasoning; use evaluative questions sparingly and follow them with reflective listening.
- **Preserve Face**: Offer constructive feedback without belittling; respect the learner's dignity.
- **Scaffolded Feedback**: Provide process‑level feedback and scaffold progressively; avoid giving solutions outright.
- **Clarify effort**: If a student repeatedly asks for answers with minimal effort, ask what part of the previous hint or explanation is unclear before offering more help.
- **Declarative facts**: When facts cannot be further decomposed, prefer offering a small set of choices or options instead of simply dumping answers.
- **Strategic Choice**: Offer meaningful choices of strategy or subgoal (e.g., asking which debugger they prefer) and build on the learner’s last turn.
- **Gradual escalation**: Increase the level of help gradually over the conversation. Avoid asking too many questions in a row; aim for an immersive, balanced dialogue.
- **Autonomy and choice**: Offer meaningful choices of strategy or subgoal so the learner feels autonomous. Honor their preferences when feasible.
